What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
We could use a linear search to search for a specific email in out inbox, if we know who sent it for instance.
What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
We might use a binary search to search through a phone book or contact list if we know the last name of the person we wish to call. 

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
Our linear search function would iterate 7 times in order to find G.
Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
Our binary search function would iterate 4 times in order to find G.
Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Unless I can force the collection to become sorted, I would have to use a linear search since a binary search will only function on a sorted collection. Since I am being provided an unsorted collection, a linear search is the only option. 
Programming Assignment:
You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
```
var sortedDict = ["Albatross", "BigFoot", "Cat", "Dog", "Emu", "Fox", "Goat"];

function search(arr, word){
  var low = arr[0];
  var high = arr[arr.length -1];
  
  while (low <= high){
    var mid = ((arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high))/2); //indexOf provides the numeric value of the var
    mid = Math.round(mid); //round mid in case of a decimal, in case of an odd number of items in our dictionary
    
    if (arr[mid] > word){
      high = arr[mid-1];
    }
    
    else if (arr[mid] < word){
      low = arr[mid+1];

    }
    
    else{
      return arr[mid];
    }
    
   
  }
  return (word+ " was not found in this collection.")
}
console.log(search(sortedDict, "Albatross"))
console.log(search(sortedDict, "Cat"))
console.log(search(sortedDict, "Llama"))
```

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

```
var aquariumOne = ['blueFish', 'redFish', 'goldFish', 'whiteSpottedFish'];

function catchFish(arr, targetFish) {
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] === targetFish){
      return ("You've caught " + targetFish + " from the tank");
     
    }
  }
  return ("That fish isn't in the tank");
}

console.log(catchFish(aquariumOne, 'whiteSpottedFish'));
console.log(catchFish(aquariumOne, 'goldFish'));
console.log(catchFish(aquariumOne, 'orangeFish'));
```
